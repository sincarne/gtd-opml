## GTD Incompletion Trigger List in OPML ##

This list is pulled from the [43 Folders Wiki Page](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Trigger_List) and coverted to OPML using [Checkvist](http://checkvist.com).

The triggers are from ~2002, and are a bit dated (got a lot of faxing to do? tapes you need to catch up on?). It's my hope that folks will grab this file and create with it a more modern set of triggers.

## Using this list ##

OPML can be imported into most outlining and mind mapping apps. I have successfully imported the file into [MindNode Pro](http://mindnode.com). Please let me know if you have trouble with your OPML handling app of choice.

## Getting Things Done ##

The source material is the excellent book [Getting Things Done](http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd). The book is highly recommended. To get you on your merry way, check out the Coles Note version from Merlin Mann's site [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done).
